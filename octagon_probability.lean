  Problem: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue
  with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that
  all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices
  is m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Find m + n.

  Solution: m + n = 115 + 256 = 371

Combinatorial argument summary:
1. For a rotation by t to work, |B| ≤ 4 (since |B| blue vertices must map to ≤ 8 - |B| red positions).
2. For |B| = 0: only ∅, 1 coloring.
3. For |B| = 1: all 8 colorings are good (rotate so blue goes to any red).
4. For |B| = 2: all C(8,2) = 28 are good (at most 2 rotations blocked, 5 remain).
5. For |B| = 3: all C(8,3) = 56 are good (at most 6 distances blocked, 1 remains).
6. For |B| = 4: C(8,4) = 70, of which 22 are good (48 bad because every distance 1..7 appears).
   A 4-subset is bad iff its set of pairwise differences covers {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}.
   There are 48 such bad subsets.
7. |B| ≥ 5: impossible (|B| > 8 - |B|, so no room for blue vertices to map to red positions).
Total: 1 + 8 + 28 + 56 + 22 = 115.
Probability: 115/256. gcd(115,256) = 1. m + n = 371.
